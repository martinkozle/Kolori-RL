### Kolori - Game Jam Plus 2021
A small game made as part of the 1st phase in Game Jam Plus 2021.
***
Goal of the game is for the player (blob) to survive for the longest time while avoiding the Erasers. Throughout the game the player can pick up buckets of various colors (purple, blue, green, yellow, and red) and gain power ups as well as change the players color and paint trail. Some of the bucket power ups can kill the Erasers that respawn over time. Paint bar depletes when the player takes damage, the player uses the current power up and over time for a small amount.

- **Blue bucket** - Projectile blast, player shoots blue at the direction of the curser, killing erasers
- **Purple bucket** - Teleportation, player teleports to the cursor's location
- **Red bucket** - bomb blast, player makes a red splash with a large AoE killing erasers around the player
- **Green bucket** - player can dash
- **Yellow bucket** - player slows down movement for erasers

# Game mechanics

Player movement is done using the [W, A, S, D] keys. All power ups can be activated multiple times at the press of [SPACE] key, for as long as there is paint left in the pain bar. Killing an eraser and picking up power ups increments the players score. Player can pause the game anytime with the [ESC] key. 

Made with Monogame, Aseprite and FL Studio.
